# is-palindrome

A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards as forwards. This sequence of characters could be a word, phrase, number, etc. For example, the word rotor remains the same even when the characters are read backwards.

In this tutorial, we will write a simple function called isPalindrome(chars) that takes a sequence of characters as input and returns true if the sequence is a palindrome, and false if it isnâ€™t.

We will implement the algorithm for this function in JavaScript using recursion, but it can also be implemented in any other language of your choosing.
